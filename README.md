# OTP Verification System

## Project Overview
This project is an OTP (One-Time Password) Verification System. It is designed to enhance security for user authentication by generating and verifying OTPs.

## Problem Statement
With increasing concerns over data security and unauthorized access, a reliable and secure method of verifying user identity is essential. Traditional password-based systems are often vulnerable to attacks. An OTP verification system provides an additional layer of security, ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive information or perform critical actions.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to implement an OTP verification system that:
- Generates a unique OTP for each verification request.
- Sends the OTP to the user's email or phone number.
- Verifies the OTP entered by the user.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **tkinter**: A micro web framework used to create the web application.
- **smtplib**: A Python library for sending emails.
- **random**: For generating random OTPs.

## Key Findings
1. **Enhanced Security**: OTP verification significantly improves the security of user authentication processes.
2. **User Experience**: Ensuring the OTP delivery is quick and reliable is crucial for maintaining a positive user experience.
3. **Scalability**: The system can be scaled to handle a large number of OTP requests and verifications.

## Personal Learnings
- **Web Development**: Gained experience in building web applications using Flask.
- **Email Handling**: Learned how to send emails programmatically using Python's `smtplib` library.
- **Security Practices**: Enhanced understanding of security measures in user authentication systems.
- **Python Programming**: Improved proficiency in Python, particularly in handling time-based operations and random number generation.
